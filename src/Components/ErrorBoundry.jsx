// * Summary

// * Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript error in their child
// * component tree, log those errors, and display a fall-back UI.

// * A class component becomes an Error Boundary by defining either or both of
// * getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch lifecycle methods.
